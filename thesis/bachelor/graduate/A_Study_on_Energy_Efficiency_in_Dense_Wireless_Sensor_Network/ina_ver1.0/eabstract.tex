The majority of IoT sensor devices are driven by battery, power saving is critical issue. 
LoRaWAN achieves wide area coverage with low power consumption in wireless sensor network (WSN). 
LoRaWAN has a scalability problem that packet transmission rate decreases due to message collision when the number of devices in WSN increase. 
In this research, we aim to improve the energy efficiency of WSNs by using 
different types of wireless communication media at long and short distances based on the method of autonomously configuring a group of multiple nodes in WSN and the leader node will be sending aggregated data messages for the rest of members. 
As a contribution of this research, knowledge about power consumption efficiency in LoRaWAN by combining different radios and existing LoRa-only WSN is expected.
